        <h1>About Franklin's Macarons</h1>
        <p>Welcome to Franklin's Macarons, where passion meets perfection in every bite!</p>
        <p>Founded in 2010 by pastry chef extraordinaire, Franklin Delacroix, our boutique bakery has been serving up colorful, delectable macarons to the delight of locals and tourists alike.</p>
        <h2>Our Story</h2>
        <p>Franklin's journey began in the heart of Paris, where he honed his craft under the tutelage of world-renowned pastry chefs. Inspired by the artistry and precision of French patisserie, Franklin returned home with a dream: to bring the magic of macarons to his hometown.</p>
